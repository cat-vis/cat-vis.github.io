Can be trivariate if faceted (cf. trellis displays). ABSTRACT: Stacked bar charts are a visualization method for presenting multiple attributes of data, and many visualization tools support these charts. To assess the efficacy of stacked bar charts in supporting attribute-comparison tasks, we conducted a user study to compare three types of stacked bar charts: classical, inverting, and diverging. Each chart type was used to visualize six attributes of data where half of the attributes have the characteristics of ‘lower better’ whereas the other half attributes are with ‘higher better.’ Thirty participants were asked to perform two types of comparison tasks: single-attribute and overall-attribute comparisons. We measured the completion time, error rate, and perceived difficulty of the comparison tasks. The results of the study suggest that, for overall-attribute comparisons, the inverting stacked bar chart was the most effective with regards to the completion time. The results also show that performing overall-attribute comparisons using the classical and diverging stacked bar charts required more time than performing single-attribute comparisons using these charts. Participants perceived the inverting and diverging stacked bar charts as easier-to-use than the classical stacked bar chart for overall-attribute comparisons. However, for single-attribute comparisons, all chart types delivered similar performance. We discuss how these findings can inform the better design of interactive stacked bar charts and visualization tools.}

@article{becker1996trellis,
  abstract={Trellis display, aka lattice plot, facet plot, faceting (cf. co-plot, conditioning plot, small multiples). ABSTRACT: Trellis display is a framework for the visualization of data. Its most prominent aspect is an overall visual design, reminiscent of a garden trelliswork, in which panels are laid out into rows, columns, and pages. On each panel of the trellis, a subset of the data is graphed by a display method such as a scatterplot, curve plot, boxplot, 3-D wireframe, normal quantile plot, or dot plot. Each panel shows the relationship of certain variables conditional on the values of other variables. A number of display methods employed in the visual design of Trellis display enable it to succeed in uncovering the structure of data even when the structure is quite complicated. For example, Trellis display provides a powerful mechanism for understanding interactions in studies of how a response depends on explanatory variables. Three examples demonstrate this; in each case, we make important discoveries not appreciated in the original analyses. Several control methods are also essential to Trellis display. A control method is a technique for specifying information so that a display can be drawn. The control methods of Trellis display form a basic conceptual framework that can be used in designing software. We have demonstrated the viability of the control methods by implementing them in the S/S-PLUS system for graphics and data analysis, but they can be implemented in any software system with a basic capability for drawing graphs.},

To emulate the percentage view of a pie chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each square representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of waffle charts do not necessarily adhere to this rule and can be created with a grid of any rectangular shape. Best practices suggest keeping the number of categories small, just as should be done when creating pie charts.

for categorical data. Although commonly used, very little guidance is available as to which method may be most
useful for different analysis tasks. This paper presents an
evaluation comparing the performance of employing quantification prior to visualization and visualization using a
method designed for categorical data. It also provides a
guidance as to which visualization approach is most useful

frequency. The results strongly indicate that the quantification approach is most efficient for the similarity related
task, whereas the visual representation designed for categorical data is most efficient for the task related to category
frequency.},

Recently, Gigerenzer and his colleagues have argued that these same distinctions are made by untutored subjects, and that, for many domains, the human mind represents probabilistic information as frequencies. We analyze several reasons why, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, certain classes of problem-solving mechanisms in the human mind should be expected to represent probabilistic information as frequencies. Then, using a problem famous in the “heuristics and biases” literature for eliciting base rate neglect, we show that correct Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in 76% of subjects - indeed, 92% in the most ecologically valid condition - simply by expressing the problem in frequentist terms. This result adds to the growing body of literature showing that frequentist representations cause various cognitive biases to disappear, including overconfidence, the conjunction fallacy, and base-rate neglect. Taken together, these new findings indicate that the conclusion most common in the literature on judgment under uncertainty - that our inductive reasoning mechanisms do not embody a calculus of probability - will have to be re-examined. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, humans may turn out to be good intuitive statisticians after all.},

ABSTRACT: Rose diagrams are powerful tools for visually representing two-dimensional orientation (and other cyclic) data. The conventional practice of scaling the wedge radius to frequency leads to exaggeration of modal orientations and should be replaced by using wedges whose area is proportional to frequency (the equal-area wedge diagram). We outline a workflow in which the type of data (vectorial or axial), sample size and the degree of preferred orientation are used to control the type of plot (discrete or binned) and the parameters used for binning the data. This allows visual comparison of data using rose diagrams that are fit-for-purpose.}

ABSTRACT: Categorical data dimensions appear in many real-world data sets, but few visualization methods exist that properly deal with them. Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data from two US states.},

ABSTRACT: Visualization can help users to analyze multidimensional datasets and make better decisions related to them. The current literature presents a set of multidimensional data visualization techniques that deal with discrete variables, continuous ones, or both. Recently, the heatmap matrix was proposed as an alternative for visualizing multidimensional datasets with discrete variables. It comprises a matrix of heatmaps, in which each heatmap shows the frequency of the values of two variables in the records of a dataset. Despite its proposed utility, it only presents a static representation of the dataset, which may limit users understanding about the dataset under analysis. Therefore, we propose to add interactive resources to this visualization, aiming to provide distinct views of a dataset. To guide the choice of new features, we compared the resources of a set of multidimensional visualizations and selected the characteristics that are suitable to enhance the heatmap matrix. We added to it resources for: (a) reordering values (rows and columns) of variables in its heatmaps; (b) filtering variables and values based on correlations of variables and on association rules; (c) discretizing continuous variables to be represented in the visual structure; among others. We present two case studies in which we show the potential of the heatmap matrix, enhanced by the resources proposed in this work, to assist the analysis of multidimensional data.},

However, the scalability and readability of this method are limited when dealing with large and dense tables. In this paper we present Contingency Wheel++, new visual analytics methods that overcome these major shortcomings: (1) regarding automated methods, a measure of association based on Pearson's residuals alleviates the bias of the raw residuals originally used, (2) regarding visualization methods, a frequency-based abstraction of the visual elements eliminates overlapping and makes analyzing both positive and negative associations possible, and (3) regarding the interactive exploration environment, a multi-level overview+detail interface enables exploring individual data items that are aggregated in the visualization or in the table using coordinated views. We illustrate the applicability of these new methods with a use case and show how they enable discovering and analyzing nontrivial patterns and associations in large categorical data.},

An example of such a variable is the classification code of
economic activity (NACE). In official statistics practice, there is a growing need for tools
to explore and analyse such high cardinality categorical hierarchical data, since tabulation
of such datasets is rather time-consuming and tedious. In this paper we propose the

innovative visualisation method for exploring large statistical datasets that helps visually
to explore relationships between variables, outliers and odd data patterns. We illustrate
the suitability of the tableplot on the Dutch insurance policy record administration, which

Traditional methods provide insights into many aspects of visual exploration of data. However, most of them lack information on relations in between categories or even clusters of categories. The force-directed network layout utilized by CatNetVis enables a lightweight approach in order to explore such semantical relations. The connections within the network are perceived as an intuitive metaphor for clusters of connections/relations in categorical data denoted as communities. While the user interacts, visual encodings such as information about the entropy and frequencies allow a fast perception of relation between categories and its frequencies, respectively. We illustrate how CatNetVis performs as an effective addition to traditional methods by demonstrating the method on an example data sets and comparing it to conventional methods.},

ABSTRACT: This paper first illustrates the use of mosaic displays and other graphical methods for the analysis of multiway contingency tables. We then introduce several extensions of mosaic displays
designed to integrate graphical methods for categorical data with those used for quantitative data.
For example, the scatterplot matrix shows all pairwise (marginal) views of a set of variables in
a coherent display. One analog for categorical data is a matrix of mosaic displays showing some
aspect of the bivariate relation between all pairs of variables. The simplest case shows the marginal
relation for each pair of variables. Another case shows the conditional relation between each pair,
with all other variables partialled out. For quantitative data this represents (a) a visualization of the
conditional independence relations studied by graphical models. and (b) a generalization of partial
residual plots.
The conditioning plot, or coplot shows a collection of (conditional) views of several variables,
conditioned by the values of one or more other variables. A direct analog of the coplot for categorical data is an array of mosaic plots of the dependence among two or more variables, stratified
by the values of one or more given variables. Each such panel then shows the partial associations
among the foreground variables; the collection of such plots show how these associations change
as the given variables vary.},

In this work, we present Taggle, a tabular visualization technique for exploring and presenting large and complex tables. Taggle takes an item-centric, spreadsheet-like approach, visualizing each row in the source data individually using visual encodings for the cells. At the same time, Taggle introduces data-driven aggregation of data subsets. The aggregation strategy is complemented by interaction methods tailored to answer specific analysis questions, such as sorting based on multiple columns and rich data selection and filtering capabilities. We demonstrate Taggle by a case study conducted by a domain expert on complex genomics data analysis for the purpose of drug discovery.},

  abstract={Gatherplot. When used with three categorical variables, it is essentially a faceted waffle chart or frequency grid with optional scaling/normalisation. ABSTRACT: Scatterplots are a common tool for exploring multidimensional datasets, especially in the form of scatterplot matrices
(SPLOMs). However, scatterplots suffer from overplotting
when categorical variables are mapped to one or two axes,
or the same continuous variable is used for both axes. Previous methods such as histograms or violin plots use aggregation, which makes brushing and linking difficult. To address
this, we propose gatherplots, an extension of scatterplots to
manage the overplotting problem. Gatherplots are a form of
unit visualization, which avoid aggregation and maintain the
identity of individual objects to ease visual perception. In
gatherplots, every visual mark that maps to the same position
coalesces to form a packed entity, thereby making it easier to
see the overview of data groupings. The size and aspect ratio
of marks can also be changed dynamically to make it easier to
compare the composition of different groups. In the case of
a categorical variable vs. a categorical variable, we propose
a heuristic to decide bin sizes for optimal space usage. To
validate our work, we conducted a crowdsourced user study
that shows that gatherplots enable people to assess data distribution more quickly and more correctly than when using
jittered scatterplots},

As designers of charts we have to make sure that information is shown with a minimum of distortion. We have to also consider illusions and other perceptual limitations of our audience. In this paper we discuss the effect and strength of the line width illusion, a Muller-Lyer type illusion, on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. Parallel sets and hammock plots are both affected by line width illusions. We introduce the common-angle plot as an alternative method for displaying categorical data in a manner that minimizes the effect from perceptual illusions. Results from user studies both highlight the need for addressing line-width illusions in displays and provide evidence that common angle charts successfully resolve this issue.},

be when incorporating these properties, and it misses out on the potential of leveraging
these properties for the data’s interactive exploration. In this paper, we present the visualization technique Parallel Hierarchies that is specifically tailored to take hierarchical
categorizations into account. With Parallel Hierarchies, it is possible to individually
adjust the desired level of detail for each categorical data property through drill-down
and roll-up operations. This enables the analyst to selectively change levels of detail as
the data analysis progresses and new questions arise. We illustrate the utility of Parallel
Hierarchies with a demographic and a biological use case, and we report on a qualitative user study evaluating this visualization technique in an industrial scenario.},

  abstract = {GPLOM (cf. Generalized Pairs Plot for heterogeneous data; Heatmap Matrix and Mosaic Matrix for purely categorical data). ABSTRACT: Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs), parallel coordinates, and glyphs can all be used to visualize the multiple continuous
variables (i.e., dependent variables or measures) in multidimensional multivariate data. However, these techniques are not well suited
to visualizing many categorical variables (i.e., independent variables or dimensions). To visualize multiple categorical variables,
“hierarchical axes” that “stack dimensions” have been used in systems like Polaris and Tableau. However, this approach does
not scale well beyond a small number of categorical variables. Emerson et al. [8] extend the matrix paradigm of the SPLOM to
simultaneously visualize several categorical and continuous variables, displaying many kinds of charts in the matrix depending on
the kinds of variables involved. We propose a variant of their technique, called the Generalized Plot Matrix (GPLOM). The GPLOM
restricts Emerson et al.’s technique to only three kinds of charts (scatterplots for pairs of continuous variables, heatmaps for pairs of
categorical variables, and barcharts for pairings of categorical and continuous variable), in an effort to make it easier to understand.
At the same time, the GPLOM extends Emerson et al.’s work by demonstrating interactive techniques suited to the matrix of charts.
We discuss the visual design and interactive features of our GPLOM prototype, including a textual search feature allowing users to
quickly locate values or variables by name. We also present a user study that compared performance with Tableau and our GPLOM
prototype, that found that GPLOM is significantly faster in certain cases, and not significantly slower in other cases.},

that most datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional
grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables
are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range
of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic
plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical
variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram, or density plot helps
visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable
for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours
or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values,
for example. By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure
in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory
data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations of the generalized
pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for this article are available

difficulty is that the visual impact of numeric values

visually highlights the prominent features of data,
while preserving the details conveyed by the numeric values themselves.
In this article, we describe the balloonplot, as
implemented by the balloonplot function in the

some observations on the balloonplot relative to the

Our work addresses the scarcity of techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension. We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color, countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus, our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before those limits are reached.},

but few visual designs have been evaluated and only populations with a specific background have been involved. In this study, a
textual and six visual representations for three classic problems were compared using a diverse subject pool through crowdsourcing.
Visualizations included area-proportional Euler diagrams, glyph representations, and hybrid diagrams combining both. Our study
failed to replicate previous findings in that subjects’ accuracy was remarkably lower and visualizations exhibited no measurable
benefit. A second experiment confirmed that simply adding a visualization to a textual Bayesian problem is of little help, even when
the text refers to the visualization, but suggests that visualizations are more effective when the text is given without numerical values.
We discuss our findings and the need for more such experiments to be carried out on heterogeneous populations of non-experts.},

and social sciences venues. It seemed timely to survey the variety of graphical methods

Du Bois wrapped bar charts enable better large-to-small bar comparison by wrapping large bars over a certain threshold. We first present two crowdsourcing experiments comparing wrapped and standard bar charts to evaluate (1) the benefit of wrapped bars in helping participants identify and compare values; (2) the characteristics of data most suitable for wrapped bars. In the first study (n=98) using real-world datasets, we find that wrapped bar charts lead to higher accuracy in identifying and estimating ratios between bars. In a follow-up study (n=190) with 13 simulated datasets, we find participants were consistently more accurate with wrapped bar charts when certain category values are disproportionate as measured by entropy and H-spread. Finally, in an in-lab study, we investigate participants' experience and strategies, leading to guidelines for when and how to use wrapped bar charts.},

ABSTRACT: This state of the art report focuses on glyph-based visualization, a common form of visual design where a data set is depicted by a collection of visual objects referred to as glyphs. Its major strength is that patterns of multivariate data involving more than two attribute dimensions can often be more readily perceived in the context of a spatial relationship, whereas many techniques for spatial data such as direct volume rendering find difficult to depict with multivariate or multi-field data, and many techniques for non-spatial data such as parallel coordinates are less able to convey spatial relationships encoded in the data. This report fills several major gaps in the literature, drawing the link between the fundamental concepts in semiotics and the broad spectrum of glyph-based visualization, reviewing existing design guidelines and implementation techniques, and surveying the use of glyph-based visualization in many applications.},

The new face can be applied in the same way as the usual Chernoff face (with 36 instead of 18 representable variables). Special appli cations of the new face are the representation of multivariate paired comparison and the visual search for outliers. Several examples illustrate these applications. Compared with Chernoffs face, the new construction is
 more realistic, degenerates less, and avoids as much as possible mutual influences of the different face parameters},

Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.},

Full scale breaks are suggested as replacements for partial scale breaks, since partial breaks can fail to provide a forceful visual indication of a change in the scale. Dot charts show data that have labels and are replacements for bar charts; the new charts can be used in a wider variety of circumstances and allow more effective visual decoding of the quantitative information.

ABSTRACT: Bar chart is a very common and simple graph that is mainly used to visualize simple x, y plots of data for numerical comparisons by partitioning the categorical data values into bars and typically limited to operate on highly aggregated dataset. In today's growing complexity of business data with multi dimensional attributes using bar chart itself is not sufficient to deal with the representation of such business dataset and it also not utilizes the screen space efficiently. Nevertheless, bar chart is still useful because of its shape create strong visual attention to users at first glance than other visualization techniques. In this article, we present a treemap bar chart + tablelens interaction technique that combines the treemap and bar chart visualizations with a tablelens based zooming technique that allows users to view the detail of a particular bar when the density of bars increases. In our approach, the capability of the original bar chart and treemaps for representing complex business data is enhanced and the utilization of display space is also optimized.},

  abstract={Conditional inference trees (see also Friendly 2015). ABSTRACT: Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental
problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known
for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits
or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the
variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression
models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a
common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning
which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional
inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and
it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance
of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore
the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an
unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with
early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable
selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems,
including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and
arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification,
node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed},

  abstract={Similar to MCA. Similar categories are positioned close to each other. ABSTRACT: Data sets with a large numbers of nominal variables, including some with large
number of distinct values, are becoming increasingly common and need to be
explored. Unfortunately, most existing visual exploration tools are designed to
handle numeric variables only. When importing data sets with nominal values
into such visualization tools, most solutions to date are rather simplistic. Often,
techniques that map nominal values to numbers do not assign order or spacing
among the values in a manner that conveys semantic relationships. Moreover,
displays designed for nominal variables usually cannot handle high cardinality
variables well. This paper addresses the problem of how to display nominal
variables in general-purpose visual exploration tools designed for numeric
variables. Specifically, we investigate (1) how to assign order and spacing
among the nominal values, and (2) how to reduce the number of distinct
values to display. We propose a new technique, called the Distance-
Quantification-Classing (DQC) approach, to preprocess nominal variables before
being imported into a visual exploration tool. In the Distance Step, we identify
a set of independent dimensions that can be used to calculate the distance
between nominal values. In the Quantification Step, we use the independent
dimensions and the distance information to assign order and spacing among
the nominal values. In the Classing Step, we use results from the previous steps
to determine which values within the domain of a variable are similar to each
other and thus can be grouped together. Each step in the DQC approach can
be accomplished by a variety of techniques. We extended the XmdvTool
package to incorporate this approach. We evaluated our approach on several
data sets using a variety of measures.}

give the conditions under which the data mapping is efficient and yet preserves a
flexible property of the original data, i.e. the data points within the same cluster
are more similar. The algorithm is simple and has good effectiveness under some
conditions. The experimental evaluation on numerous categorical data sets shows
that it not only outperforms the related data mapping approaches but also beats
some categorical clustering algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.}

two visual tasks: finding groups of similar values of a

assist in these tasks, we develop an algorithm that orders categorical values using the following steps: (1)
construct natural clusters of categorical values based
on domain semantics (e.g., group together hosts that
emit events at the same time); (2) order the clusters;
and (3) order the categorical values within each cluster. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach

Firstly, the various plot types (such as clustering scatter plot, dendrogram, icicle plot) for cluster analysis are presented, and their suitability for presenting clusters of nominal data is discussed. Then, we study approaches of sorting nominal values on chart axes in such a way that would improve visualization of the data.

  abstract={Association rules are amongst the most important patterns
that can be discovered using data mining. Their automatic
discovery is supported by most, if not all, data mining software
tools. Moreover, many techniques have been devised
to filter the most interesting (in many senses) rules from the
complete set of discovered rules, such that the users are not
swamped by results.
However, association rules are actually hard to understand;
even more so if one only looks at the most interesting rules.
For example, rather strong correlations between attributes
are not always obvious from the discovered rules. Similarly,
a deeper explanation of related association rules may be
missing from the rule set.
In this paper we show how Mosaic plots and, especially, their
variant called Double Decker plots, can be used to visualize
association rules. These plots visualize the contingency table
that yields the association rule as well as the other potential
rules in that table, whether they meet the thresholds or
not. This gives a deeper understanding on the nature of the
correlation between the left-hand side of the rule and the
right-hand side.
Moreover, we show how an interactive use of these plots
helps the user to understand the relationship between related
association rules.},

However, most of the existing studies focus on simple flat tables instead of hierarchical tables, whose complex structure limits the expressiveness of visualization results and affects users' efficiency in visualization construction. We present HiTailor, a technique for presenting and exploring hierarchical tables. HiTailor constructs an abstract model, which defines row/column headings as biclustering and hierarchical structures. Based on our abstract model, we identify three pairs of operators, Swap/Transpose, ToStacked/ToLinear, Fold/Unfold, for transformations of hierarchical tables to support users' comprehensive explorations. After transformation, users can specify a cell or block of interest in hierarchical tables as a TableUnit for visualization, and HiTailor recommends other related TableUnits according to the abstract model using different mechanisms. We demonstrate the usability of the HiTailor system through a comparative study and a case study with domain experts, showing that HiTailor can present and explore hierarchical tables from different viewpoints.

  abstract={Classifying a set of objects into clusters can be done in numerous ways, producing different results. They can be visually compared using contingency tables [27], mosaicplots [13], fluctuation diagrams [15], tableplots [20] , (modified) parallel coordinates plots [28], Parallel Sets plots [18] or circos diagrams [19]. Unfortunately the interpretability of all these graphical displays decreases rapidly with the numbers of categories and clusterings. In his famous book A Semiology of Graphics [5] Bertin writes “the discovery of an ordered concept appears as the ultimate point in logical simplification since it permits reducing to a single instant the assimilation of series which previously required many instants of study”. Or in more everyday language, if you use good orderings you can see results immediately that with other orderings might take a lot of effort. This is also related to the idea of effect ordering [12], that data should be organised to reflect the effect you want to observe. This paper presents an efficient algorithm based on Bertin's idea and concepts related to Kendall's t [17], which finds informative joint orders for two or more nominal classification variables. We also show how these orderings improve the various displays and how groups of corresponding categories can be detected using a top-down partitioning algorithm. Different clusterings based on data on the environmental performance of cars sold in Germany are used for illustration. All presented methods are available in the R package extracat which is used to compute the optimized orderings for the example dataset.},

Displaying the expected values of a loglinear model allows one to incorporate the residuals of the model graphically and to visually judge the adequacy of the loglinear fit.

The book is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the social and health sciences, epidemiology, economics, business, statistics, and biostatistics as well as researchers, methodologists, and consultants who can use the methods with their own data and analyses. Along with describing the necessary statistical theory, the authors illustrate the practical application of the techniques to a large number of substantive problems, including how to organize data, conduct an analysis, produce informative graphs, and evaluate what the graphs reveal about the data.

The first part of the book contains introductory material on graphical methods for discrete data, basic R skills, and methods for fitting and visualizing one-way discrete distributions. The second part focuses on simple, traditional nonparametric tests and exploratory methods for visualizing patterns of association in two-way and larger frequency tables.

  abstract={Clustering is an important data mining problem. However, most earlier work on clustering focused on
numeric attributes which have a natural ordering to their attribute values. Recently, clustering data with
categorical attributes, whose attribute values do not have a natural ordering, has received more attention.
A common issue in cluster analysis is that there is no single correct answer to the number of clusters, since
cluster analysis involves human subjective judgement. Interactive visualization is one of the methods where
users can decide a proper clustering parameters. In this paper, a new clustering approach called CDCS
(Categorical Data Clustering with Subjective factors) is introduced, where a visualization tool for clustered
categorical data is developed such that the result of adjusting parameters is instantly reflected. The experiment
shows that CDCS generates high quality clusters compared to other typical algorithms.},

  abstract={Categorical Stacked Parallel Coordinate Plots (3D display). ABSTRACT: An ongoing challenge for information visualization is how to deal with over-plotting forced by ties or the relatively limited visual field of display devices. A popular solution is to represent local data density with area (bubble plots, treemaps), color (heatmaps), or aggregation (histograms, kernel densities, pixel displays). All of these methods have at least one of three deficiencies: 1) magnitude judgments are biased because area and color have convex downward perceptual functions, 2) area, hue, and brightness have relatively restricted ranges of perceptual intensity compared to length representations, and/or 3) it is difficult to brush or link to individual cases when viewing aggregations. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for visualizing and interacting with datasets that preserves density information by stacking overlapping cases. The overlapping data can be points or lines or other geometric elements, depending on the type of plot. We show real-dataset applications of this stacking paradigm and compare them to other techniques that deal with over-plotting in high-dimensional displays.},

  abstract={Evaluation metrics for Parallel Sets. ABSTRACT: While there are many visualization techniques for exploring numeric data, only a few work with categorical data. One prominent example is Parallel Sets, showing data frequencies instead of data points - analogous to parallel coordinates for numerical data. As nominal data does not have an intrinsic order, the design of Parallel Sets is sensitive to visual clutter due to overlaps, crossings, and subdivision of ribbons hindering readability and pattern detection. In this paper, we propose a set of quality metrics, called ParSetgnostics (Parallel Sets diagnostics), which aim to improve Parallel Sets by reducing clutter. These quality metrics quantify important properties of Parallel Sets such as overlap, orthogonality, ribbon width variance, and mutual information to optimize the category and dimension ordering. By conducting a systematic correlation analysis between the individual
metrics, we ensure their distinctiveness. Further, we evaluate the clutter reduction effect of ParSetgnostics by reconstructing six
datasets from previous publications using Parallel Sets measuring and comparing their respective properties. Our results show
that ParSetgostics facilitates multi-dimensional analysis of categorical data by automatically providing optimized Parallel Set
designs with a clutter reduction of up to 81% compared to the originally proposed Parallel Sets visualizations.},

  abstract={Self-organizing maps (SOM) for categorical data. ABSTRACT: The self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised
neural network which projects high-dimensional data onto a
low-dimensional grid and visually reveals the topological order of
the original data. Self-organizing maps have been successfully applied
to many fields, including engineering and business domains.
However, the conventional SOM training algorithm handles only
numeric data. Categorical data are usually converted to a set of
binary data before training of an SOM takes place. If a simple
transformation scheme is adopted, the similarity information
embedded between categorical values may be lost. Consequently,
the trained SOM is unable to reflect the correct topological order.
This paper proposes a generalized self-organizing map model that
offers an intuitive method of specifying the similarity between
categorical values via distance hierarchies and, hence, enables the
direct process of categorical values during training. In fact, distance
hierarchy unifies the distance computation of both numeric
and categorical values. The unification is done by mapping the
values to distance hierarchies and then measuring the distance in
the hierarchies. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets were
conducted, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the
generalized SOM model.}

  abstract={Radial Icicle Tree (RIT, cf. sunburst chart and icicle plot). ABSTRACT: Icicles and sunbursts are two commonly-used visual representations of trees. While icicle trees can map data values faithfully to rectangles of different sizes, often some rectangles are too narrow to be noticed easily. When an icicle tree is transformed into a sunburst tree, the width of each rectangle becomes the length of an annular sector that is usually longer than the original width. While sunburst trees alleviate the problem of narrow rectangles in icicle trees, it no longer maintains the consistency of size encoding. At different tree depths, nodes of the same data values are displayed in annular sections of different sizes in a sunburst tree, though they are represented by rectangles of the same size in an icicle tree. Furthermore, two nodes from different subtrees could sometimes appear as a single node in both icicle trees and sunburst trees. In this paper, we propose a new visual representation, referred to as radial icicle tree (RIT), which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied the new visual design to several datasets. Both the analytical design process and user-centered evaluation have confirmed that this new design has improved the design of icicles and sunburst trees without introducing any relative demerit.},
