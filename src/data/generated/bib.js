        "abstract": "A wide variety of real-world applications generate massive high dimensional categorical datasets. These datasets contain categorical variables whose values comprise a set of discrete categories. Visually exploring these datasets for insights is of great interest and importance. However, their discrete nature often confounds the direct application of existing multidimensional visualization techniques. We use measures of entropy, mutual information, and joint entropy as a means of harnessing this discreteness to generate more effective visualizations. We conduct user studies to assess the benefits in visual knowledge discovery.",

ABSTRACT: We present the Contingency Wheel, a visual method for finding and analyzing associations in a large n<m contingency table with m < 100 and n being two to three orders of magnitude larger than m. The method is demonstrated on a large table from the Book-Crossing dataset, which counts the number of ratings each book received from each country. It enables finding books that received a disproportionately high number of ratings from a specific country. It further allows to visually analyze what these books have in common, and with which countries they are also highly associated. Pairs of similar countries can further be identified (in the sense that many books are associated with both countries). Compared with existing visual methods, our approach enables analyzing and gaining insight into larger tables.",

        "abstract": "ContingencyWheel++. ABSTRACT: Contingency tables summarize the relations between categorical variables and arise in both scientific and business domains. Asymmetrically large two-way contingency tables pose a problem for common visualization methods. The Contingency Wheel has been recently proposed as an interactive visual method to explore and analyze such tables. However, the scalability and readability of this method are limited when dealing with large and dense tables. In this paper we present Contingency Wheel++, new visual analytics methods that overcome these major shortcomings: (1) regarding automated methods, a measure of association based on Pearson's residuals alleviates the bias of the raw residuals originally used, (2) regarding visualization methods, a frequency-based abstraction of the visual elements eliminates overlapping and makes analyzing both positive and negative associations possible, and (3) regarding the interactive exploration environment, a multi-level overview+detail interface enables exploring individual data items that are aggregated in the visualization or in the table using coordinated views. We illustrate the applicability of these new methods with a use case and show how they enable discovering and analyzing nontrivial patterns and associations in large categorical data.",

        "abstract": "Trellis display, aka lattice plot, facet plot, faceting (cf. co-plot, conditioning plot, small multiples). ABSTRACT: Trellis display is a framework for the visualization of data. Its most prominent aspect is an overall visual design, reminiscent of a garden trelliswork, in which panels are laid out into rows, columns, and pages. On each panel of the trellis, a subset of the data is graphed by a display method such as a scatterplot, curve plot, boxplot, 3-D wireframe, normal quantile plot, or dot plot. Each panel shows the relationship of certain variables conditional on the values of other variables. A number of display methods employed in the visual design of Trellis display enable it to succeed in uncovering the structure of data even when the structure is quite complicated. For example, Trellis display provides a powerful mechanism for understanding interactions in studies of how a response depends on explanatory variables. Three examples demonstrate this; in each case, we make important discoveries not appreciated in the original analyses. Several control methods are also essential to Trellis display. A control method is a technique for specifying information so that a display can be drawn. The control methods of Trellis display form a basic conceptual framework that can be used in designing software. We have demonstrated the viability of the control methods by implementing them in the S/S-PLUS system for graphics and data analysis, but they can be implemented in any software system with a basic capability for drawing graphs.",

ABSTRACT: This state of the art report focuses on glyph-based visualization, a common form of visual design where a data set is depicted by a collection of visual objects referred to as glyphs. Its major strength is that patterns of multivariate data involving more than two attribute dimensions can often be more readily perceived in the context of a spatial relationship, whereas many techniques for spatial data such as direct volume rendering find difficult to depict with multivariate or multi-field data, and many techniques for non-spatial data such as parallel coordinates are less able to convey spatial relationships encoded in the data. This report fills several major gaps in the literature, drawing the link between the fundamental concepts in semiotics and the broad spectrum of glyph-based visualization, reviewing existing design guidelines and implementation techniques, and surveying the use of glyph-based visualization in many applications.",

We use a treeview to show attributes and their domains, a histogram of their representativity in the data set and as a compact overview of attribute-related facts. A second view shows both attributes and observations. We use a Voronoi diagram whose cells can be interactively merged to discover salient attributes, cluster values and bin categories.

Interactive visualization is one of the methods where users can decide a proper clustering parameters. In this paper, a new clustering approach called CDCS (Categorical Data Clustering with Subjective factors) is introduced, where a visualization tool for clustered categorical data is developed such that the result of adjusting parameters is instantly reflected.

Firstly, the various plot types (such as clustering scatter plot, dendrogram, icicle plot) for cluster analysis are presented, and their suitability for presenting clusters of nominal data is discussed. Then, we study approaches of sorting nominal values on chart axes in such a way that would improve visualization of the data. Lastly, we introduce a simple alternative to cluster scatter plot for nominal data, that makes the final visualization of clustering solution more efficient since the pattern and groups in data are now more apparent. The suggested method is demonstrated in illustrative examples.",

Several methods-full scale breaks, dot charts, and multibased logging-are discussed. Full scale breaks are suggested as replacements for partial scale breaks, since partial breaks can fail to provide a forceful visual indication of a change in the scale. Dot charts show data that have labels and are replacements for bar charts; the new charts can be used in a wider variety of circumstances and allow more effective visual decoding of the quantitative infor- mation. Logarithms are powerful tools for data presentation; base 2 or base e is often more effective than the commonly used base 10.",

        "abstract": "Professional probabilists have long argued over what probability means, with, for example, Bayesians arguing that probabilities refer to subjective degrees of confidence and frequentists arguing that probabilities refer to the frequencies of events in the world. Recently, Gigerenzer and his colleagues have argued that these same distinctions are made by untutored subjects, and that, for many domains, the human mind represents probabilistic information as frequencies. We analyze several reasons why, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, certain classes of problem-solving mechanisms in the human mind should be expected to represent probabilistic information as frequencies. Then, using a problem famous in the \u201cheuristics and biases\u201d literature for eliciting base rate neglect, we show that correct Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in 76% of subjects - indeed, 92% in the most ecologically valid condition - simply by expressing the problem in frequentist terms. This result adds to the growing body of literature showing that frequentist representations cause various cognitive biases to disappear, including overconfidence, the conjunction fallacy, and base-rate neglect. Taken together, these new findings indicate that the conclusion most common in the literature on judgment under uncertainty - that our inductive reasoning mechanisms do not embody a calculus of probability - will have to be re-examined. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, humans may turn out to be good intuitive statisticians after all.",

This coefficient can be decomposed into several components, one component for each principal dimension, indicating the contribution of the dimensions to the difference between the two representations.

ABSTRACT: An ongoing challenge for information visualization is how to deal with over-plotting forced by ties or the relatively limitedvisual field of display devices. A popular solution is to represent local data density with area (bubble plots, treemaps), color(heatmaps), or aggregation (histograms, kernel densities, pixel displays). All of these methods have at least one of three deficiencies:1) magnitude judgments are biased because area and color have convex downward perceptual functions, 2) area, hue, and brightnesshave relatively restricted ranges of perceptual intensity compared to length representations, and/or 3) it is difficult to brush or link toindividual cases when viewing aggregations. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for visualizing and interacting with datasetsthat preserves density information by stacking overlapping cases. The overlapping data can be points or lines or other geometricelements, depending on the type of plot. We show real-dataset applications of this stacking paradigm and compare them to othertechniques that deal with over-plotting in high-dimensional displays.",

        "abstract": "Evaluation metrics for Parallel Sets. ABSTRACT: While there are many visualization techniques for exploring numeric data, only a few work with categorical data. One prominent example is Parallel Sets, showing data frequencies instead of data points - analogous to parallel coordinates for numerical data. As nominal data does not have an intrinsic order, the design of Parallel Sets is sensitive to visual clutter due to overlaps, crossings, and subdivision of ribbons hindering readability and pattern detection. In this paper, we propose a set of quality metrics, called ParSetgnostics (Parallel Sets diagnostics), which aim to improve Parallel Sets by reducing clutter. These quality metrics quantify important properties of Parallel Sets such as overlap, orthogonality, ribbon width variance, and mutual information to optimize the category and dimension ordering. By conducting a systematic correlation analysis between the individual metrics, we ensure their distinctiveness. Further, we evaluate the clutter reduction effect of ParSetgnostics by reconstructing six datasets from previous publications using Parallel Sets measuring and comparing their respective properties. Our results show that ParSetgostics facilitates multi-dimensional analysis of categorical data by automatically providing optimized Parallel Set designs with a clutter reduction of up to 81% compared to the originally proposed Parallel Sets visualizations.",

ABSTRACT: This article develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for this article are available online on the journal web site.",

ABSTRACT: Proceeding from the idea of Chernoff (1971, 1973) of rep- resenting multivariate data by faces, a new face is pro- posed in which the face parameters of the left and the right side can be varied separately. The new face can be applied in the same way as the usual Chernoff face (with 36 instead of 18 representable variables). Special appli- cations of the new face are the representation of multi- variate paired comparison and the visual search for out- liers. Several examples illustrate these applications. Compared with Chernoffs face, the new construction is more realistic, degenerates less, and avoids as much as possible mutual influences of the different face parameters",

ABSTRACT: This paper first illustrates the use of mosaic displays and other graphical methods for the analysis of multiway contingency tables. We then introduce several extensions of mosaic displays designed to integrate graphical methods for categorical data with those used for quantitative data. For example, the scatterplot matrix shows all pairwise (marginal) views of a set of variables in a coherent display. One analog for categorical data is a matrix of mosaic displays showing some aspect of the bivariate relation between all pairsof variables. The simplest case shows the marginal relation for each pair of variables. Another case shows the conditional relation between each pair, with all other variablespartialled out. For quantitative data this represents (a) a visualization of the conditional independence relations studied by graphical models. and (b) a generalization of partial residual plots. The conditioning plot, or coplot shows a collection of (conditional) views of several variables, conditioned by the values of one or more other variables. A direct analog of the coplot for categorical data is an array of mosaic plots of the dependence among two or more variables, stratified by the values of one or more given variables. Each such panel then shows the partial associations among the foreground variables; the collection of such plots show how these associations change as the given variables vary.",

Taggle takes an item-centric, spreadsheet-like approach, visualizing each row in the source data individually using visual encodings for the cells. At the same time, Taggle introduces data-driven aggregation of data subsets. The aggregation strategy is complemented by interaction methods tailored to answer specific analysis questions, such as sorting based on multiple columns and rich data selection and filtering capabilities. We demonstrate Taggle by a case study conducted by a domain expert on complex genomics data analysis for the purpose of drug discovery.",

However, association rules are actually hard to understand; even more so if one only looks at the most interesting rules. For example, rather strong correlations between attributes are not always obvious from the discovered rules. Similarly, a deeper explanation of related association rules may be missing from the rule set. In this paper we show how Mosaic plots and, especially, their variant called Double Decker plots, can be used to visualize association rules. These plots visualize the contingency table that yields the association rule as well as the other potential rules in that table, whether they meet the thresholds or not. This gives a deeper understanding on the nature of the correlation between the left-hand side of the rule and the right-hand side. Moreover, we show how an interactive use of these plots helps the user to understand the relationship between related association rules.",

In this paper we discuss the effect and strength of the line width illusion, a Muller-Lyer type illusion, on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. Parallel sets and hammock plots are both affected by line width illusions. We introduce the common-angle plot as an alternative method for displaying categorical data in a manner that minimizes the effect from perceptual illusions. Results from user studies both highlight the need for addressing line-width illusions in displays and provide evidence that common angle charts successfully resolve this issue.",

        "abstract": "Conditional inference trees (see also Friendly 2015). ABSTRACT: Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed",

ABSTRACT: The self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised neural network which projects high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional grid and visually reveals the topological order of the original data. Self-organizing maps have been successfully applied to many fields, including engineering and business domains. However, the conventional SOM training algorithm handles only numeric data. Categorical data are usually converted to a set of binary data before training of an SOM takes place. If a simple transformation scheme is adopted, the similarity information embedded between categorical values may be lost. Consequently, the trained SOM is unable to reflect the correct topological order. This paper proposes a generalized self-organizing map model that offers an intuitive method of specifying the similarity between categorical values via distance hierarchies and, hence, enables the direct process of categorical values during training. In fact, distance hierarchy unifies the distance computation of both numeric and categorical values. The unification is done by mapping the values to distance hierarchies and then measuring the distance in the hierarchies. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets were conducted, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the generalized SOM model.",

ABSTRACT: Bar chart is a very common and simple graph that is mainly used to visualize simple x, y plots of data for numerical comparisons by partitioning the categorical data values into bars and typically limited to operate on highly aggregated dataset. In todaypsilas growing complexity of business data with multi dimensional attributes using bar chart itself is not sufficient to deal with the representation of such business dataset and it also not utilizes the screen space efficiently.Nevertheless, bar chart is still useful because of its shape create strong visual attention to users at first glance than other visualization techniques. In this article, we present a treemap bar chart + tablelens interaction technique that combines the treemap and bar chart visualizations with a tablelens based zooming technique that allows users to view the detail of a particular bar when the density of bars increases. In our approach, the capability of the original bar chart and treemaps for representing complex business data is enhanced and the utilization of display space is also optimized.",

ABSTRACT: Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs), parallel coordinates, and glyphs can all be used to visualize the multiple continuous variables (i.e., dependent variables or measures) in multidimensional multivariate data. However, these techniques are not well suited to visualizing many categorical variables (i.e., independent variables or dimensions). To visualize multiple categorical variables, \u201chierarchical axes\u201d that \u201cstack dimensions\u201d have been used in systems like Polaris and Tableau. However, this approach does not scale well beyond a small number of categorical variables. Emerson et al. [8] extend the matrix paradigm of the SPLOM to simultaneously visualize several categorical and continuous variables, displaying many kinds of charts in the matrix depending on the kinds of variables involved. We propose a variant of their technique, called the Generalized Plot Matrix (GPLOM). The GPLOM restricts Emerson et al.\u2019s technique to only three kinds of charts (scatterplots for pairs of continuous variables, heatmaps for pairs of categorical variables, and barcharts for pairings of categorical and continuous variable), in an effort to make it easier to understand. At the same time, the GPLOM extends Emerson et al.\u2019s work by demonstrating interactive techniques suited to the matrix of charts. We discuss the visual design and interactive features of our GPLOM prototype, including a textual search feature allowing users to quickly locate values or variables by name. We also present a user study that compared performance with Tableau and our GPLOM prototype, that found that GPLOM is significantly faster in certain cases, and not significantly slower in other cases.",

ABSTRACT: Stacked bar charts are a visualization method for presenting multiple attributes of data, and many visualization tools support these charts. To assess the efficacy of stacked bar charts in supporting attribute-comparison tasks, we conducted a user study to compare three types of stacked bar charts: classical, inverting, and diverging. Each chart type was used to visualize six attributes of data where half of the attributes have the characteristics of \u2018lower better\u2019 whereas the other half attributes are with \u2018higher better.\u2019 Thirty participants were asked to perform two types of comparison tasks: single-attribute and overall-attribute comparisons. We measured the completion time, error rate, and perceived difficulty of the comparison tasks. The results of the study suggest that, for overall-attribute comparisons, the inverting stacked bar chart was the most effective with regards to the completion time. The results also show that performing overall-attribute comparisons using the classical and diverging stacked bar charts required more time than performing single-attribute comparisons using these charts. Participants perceived the inverting and diverging stacked bar charts as easier-to-use than the classical stacked bar chart for overall-attribute comparisons. However, for single-attribute comparisons, all chart types delivered similar performance. We discuss how these findings can inform the better design of interactive stacked bar charts and visualization tools.",

This visually highlights the prominent features of data, while preserving the details conveyed by the numeric values themselves.

While icicle trees can map data values faithfully to rectangles of different sizes, often some rectangles are too narrow to be noticed easily. When an icicle tree is transformed into a sunburst tree, the width of each rectangle becomes the length of an annular sector that is usually longer than the original width. While sunburst trees alleviate the problem of narrow rectangles in icicle trees, it no longer maintains the consistency of size encoding. At different tree depths, nodes of the same data values are displayed in annular sections of different sizes in a sunburst tree, though they are represented by rectangles of the same size in an icicle tree. Furthermore, two nodes from different subtrees could sometimes appear as a single node in both icicle trees and sunburst trees. In this paper, we propose a new visual representation, referred to as radial icicle tree (RIT), which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied the new visual design to several datasets. Both the analytical design process and user-centered evaluation have confirmed that this new design has improved the design of icicles and sunburst trees without introducing any relative demerit.",

This paper presents an evaluation comparing the performance of employing quantification prior to visualization and visualization using a method designed for categorical data. It also provides a guidance as to which visualization approach is most useful in the context of two basic data analysis tasks: one related to similarity structures and one related to category frequency. The results strongly indicate that the quantification approach is most efficient for the similarity related task, whereas the visual representation designed for categorical data is most efficient for the task related to category frequency.",

ABSTRACT: Categorical data dimensions appear in many real-world data sets, but few visualization methods exist that properly deal with them. Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data from two US states.",

ABSTRACT: We created a visualization tool called Circos to facilitate the identification and analysis of similarities and differences arising from comparisons of genomes. Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.",

ABSTRACT: The ability of researchers in the scientific and engineering community to generate or acquire data far outstrips their ability to analyze it. This problem is even more pronounced when the data is of high dimensionality. Visualization has been identified as a critical technique for exploring data sets, but the visualization tools developed to date have mostly concentrated on the display of low (one to four) dimensional data. Ideally a tool for examining N-dimensional data should allow the presentation of the data in a way that can be intuitively interpreted and allow the display of arbitrary views and subsets of the data. The work presented in this paper describes the creation of such a tool using a technique which we term dimensional stacking.",

However, most of the existing studies focus on simple flat tables instead of hierarchical tables, whose complex structure limits the expressiveness of visualization results and affects users' efficiency in visualization construction. We present HiTailor, a technique for presenting and exploring hierarchical tables. HiTailor constructs an abstract model, which defines row/column headings as biclustering and hierarchical structures. Based on our abstract model, we identify three pairs of operators, Swap/Transpose, ToStacked/ToLinear, Fold/Unfold, for transformations of hierarchical tables to support users' comprehensive explorations. After transformation, users can specify a cell or block of interest in hierarchical tables as a TableUnit for visualization, and HiTailor recommends other related TableUnits according to the abstract model using different mechanisms. We demonstrate the usability of the HiTailor system through a comparative study and a case study with domain experts, showing that HiTailor can present and explore hierarchical tables from different viewpoints.

SellTrend combines a diverse set of techniques ranging from time series visualization to faceted browsing and historical trend analysis in order to help analysts make sense of the data. We believe that the combination of views and interaction capabilities in SellTrend provides an innovative approach to this problem and to other similar types of multivariate, temporally-driven transaction data analysis.

In domains such as network management, these data often have categorical attributes, such as host names and event types. Unfortunately, large scale visualizations of categorical data are diffcult to construct since categorical values have no inherent order. We consider two visual tasks: finding groups of similar values of a single categorical attribute and finding relationships between values of different categorical attributes. To assist in these tasks, we develop an algorithm that orders categorical values using the following steps: (1) construct natural clusters of categorical values based on domain semantics (e.g., group together hosts that emit events at the same time); (2) order the clusters; and (3) order the categorical values within each cluster. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to scatter plots and parallel coordinate plots of event data collected from a corporate Intranet.",

Our study failed to replicate previous findings in that subjects\u2019 accuracy was remarkably lower and visualizations exhibited no measurable benefit.

ABSTRACT: Scatterplots are a common tool for exploring multidimensional datasets, especially in the form of scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs). However, scatterplots suffer from overplotting when categorical variables are mapped to one or two axes, or the same continuous variable is used for both axes. Previous methods such as histograms or violin plots use aggregation, which makes brushing and linking difficult. To address this, we propose gatherplots, an extension of scatterplots to manage the overplotting problem. Gatherplots are a form of unit visualization, which avoid aggregation and maintain the identity of individual objects to ease visual perception. In gatherplots, every visual mark that maps to the same position coalesces to form a packed entity, thereby making it easier to see the overview of data groupings. The size and aspect ratio of marks can also be changed dynamically to make it easier to compare the composition of different groups. In the case of a categorical variable vs. a categorical variable, we propose a heuristic to decide bin sizes for optimal space usage. To validate our work, we conducted a crowdsourced user study that shows that gatherplots enable people to assess data distribution more quickly and more correctly than when using jittered scatterplots",

        "abstract": "Classifying a set of objects into clusters can be done in numerous ways, producing different results. They can be visually compared using contingency tables [27], mosaicplots [13], fluctuation diagrams [15], tableplots [20] , (modified) parallel coordinates plots [28], Parallel Sets plots [18] or circos diagrams [19]. Unfortunately the interpretability of all these graphical displays decreases rapidly with the numbers of categories and clusterings. In his famous book A Semiology of Graphics [5] Bertin writes \u201cthe discovery of an ordered concept appears as the ultimate point in logical simplification since it permits reducing to a single instant the assimilation of series which previously required many instants of study\u201d. Or in more everyday language, if you use good orderings you can see results immediately that with other orderings might take a lot of effort. This is also related to the idea of effect ordering [12], that data should be organised to reflect the effect you want to observe. This paper presents an efficient algorithm based on Bertin's idea and concepts related to Kendall's t [17], which finds informative joint orders for two or more nominal classification variables. We also show how these orderings improve the various displays and how groups of corresponding categories can be detected using a top-down partitioning algorithm. Different clusterings based on data on the environmental performance of cars sold in Germany are used for illustration. All presented methods are available in the R package extracat which is used to compute the optimized orderings for the example dataset.",

We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension. We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color, countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus, our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before those limits are reached.",

ABSTRACT: Visualization can help users to analyze multidimensional datasets and make better decisions related to them. The current literature presents a set of multidimensional data visualization techniques that deal with discrete variables, continuous ones, or both. Recently, the heatmap matrix was proposed as an alternative for visualizing multidimensional datasets with discrete variables. It comprises a matrix of heatmaps, in which each heatmap shows the frequency of the values of two variables in the records of a dataset. Despite its proposed utility, it only presents a static representation of the dataset, which may limit users understanding about the dataset under analysis. Therefore, we propose to add interactive resources to this visualization, aiming to provide distinct views of a dataset. To guide the choice of new features, we compared the resources of a set of multidimensional visualizations and selected the characteristics that are suitable to enhance the heatmap matrix. We added to it resources for: (a) reordering values (rows and columns) of variables in its heatmaps; (b) filtering variables and values based on correlations of variables and on association rules; (c) discretizing continuous variables to be represented in the visual structure; among others. We present two case studies in which we show the potential of the heatmap matrix, enhanced by the resources proposed in this work, to assist the analysis of multidimensional data.",

        "abstract": "Similar to MCA. Similar categories are positioned close to each other. ABSTRACT: Data sets with a large numbers of nominal variables, including some with large number of distinct values, are becoming increasingly common and need to be explored. Unfortunately, most existing visual exploration tools are designed to handle numeric variables only. When importing data sets with nominal values into such visualization tools, most solutions to date are rather simplistic. Often, techniques that map nominal values to numbers do not assign order or spacing among the values in a manner that conveys semantic relationships. Moreover, displays designed for nominal variables usually cannot handle high cardinality variables well. This paper addresses the problem of how to display nominal variables in general-purpose visual exploration tools designed for numeric variables. Specifically, we investigate (1) how to assign order and spacing among the nominal values, and (2) how to reduce the number of distinct values to display. We propose a new technique, called the Distance- Quantification-Classing (DQC) approach, to preprocess nominal variables before being imported into a visual exploration tool. In the Distance Step, we identify a set of independent dimensions that can be used to calculate the distance between nominal values. In the Quantification Step, we use the independent dimensions and the distance information to assign order and spacing among the nominal values. In the Classing Step, we use results from the previous steps to determine which values within the domain of a variable are similar to each other and thus can be grouped together. Each step in the DQC approach can be accomplished by a variety of techniques. We extended the XmdvTool package to incorporate this approach. We evaluated our approach on several data sets using a variety of measures.",

To emulate the percentage view of a pie chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each square representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of waffle charts do not necessarily adhere to this rule and can be created with a grid of any rectangular shape. Best practices suggest keeping the number of categories small, just as should be done when creating pie charts.

The conventional practice of scaling the wedge radius to frequency leads to exaggeration of modal orientations and should be replaced by using wedges whose area is proportional to frequency (the equal-area wedge diagram). We outline a workflow in which the type of data (vectorial or axial), sample size and the degree of preferred orientation are used to control the type of plot (discrete or binned) and the parameters used for binning the data.

The algorithm is simple and has good effectiveness under some conditions. The experimental evaluation on numerous categorical data sets shows that it not only outperforms the related data mapping approaches but also beats some categorical clustering algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

ABSTRACT: The traditional approach to representing tree structures is as a rooted, directed graph with the root node at the top of the page and children nodes below the parent node with lines connecting them (Figure 1). Knuth [21 has a long discussion about this standard representation, especially why the root is at the top, and he offers several alternatives including brief mention of a space-filling approach. However, the remainder of his presentation and most other discussions of trees focus on various node and edge representations. By contrast, this paper deals with a two-dimensional (2-d) space-filling approach in which each node is a rectangle whose area is proportional to some attribute such as node size",

Users appreciate the meaningful and limited number of terms on each hieraxis. At each grid point of the display we show a cluster of colorcoded dots or a bar chart. Users see the entire result set and can then click on labels to move down a level in the hierarchy. Handling broad hierarchies and arranging for imposed hierarchies led to additional design innovations.

Little known is the fact that the first graphical summary of the initial survivor data appeared in The Sphere, a British newspaper, on May 4, 1912. The public inquiries that followed produced detailed data sets that have been widely used to illustrate graphical and statistical methods for quite some time. Numerous follow-up studies have used a wide variety of graphical representations related to the Titanic disaster, published in statistics, information visualization, and social sciences venues. It seemed timely to survey the variety of graphical methods used for these data sets over the last century. Graph types used to portray the Titanic data include: dot plots, bar charts, mosaic plots, doubledecker plots, parallel set plots, Venn diagrams, balloon plots, nomograms, and tree diagrams to name only a few.

An example of such a variable is the classification code of economic activity (NACE). In official statistics practice, there is a growing need for tools to explore and analyse such high cardinality categorical hierarchical data, since tabulation of such datasets is rather time-consuming and tedious. In this paper we propose the tableplot as a candidate tool to explore high cardinality data. The tableplot is an innovative visualisation method for exploring large statistical datasets that helps visually to explore relationships between variables, outliers and odd data patterns. We illustrate the suitability of the tableplot on the Dutch insurance policy record administration, which is a large data source with high cardinality hierarchical variables.",

The force-directed network layout utilized by CatNetVis enables a lightweight approach in order to explore such semantical relations. The connections within the network are perceived as an intuitive metaphor for clusters of connections/relations in categorical data denoted as communities. While the user interacts, visual encodings such as information about the entropy and frequencies allow a fast perception of relation between categories and its frequencies, respectively. We illustrate how CatNetVis performs as an effective addition to traditional methods by demonstrating the method on an example data sets and comparing it to conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "We consider visual methods based on mosaic plots for interpreting and modeling categorical data. Categorical data are most often modeled using loglinear models. For certain loglinear models, mosaic plots have unique shapes that do not depend on the actual data being modeled. These shapes reflect the structure of a model, defined by the presence and absence of particular model coefficients. Displaying the expected values of a loglinear model allows one to incorporate the residuals of the model graphically and to visually judge the adequacy of the loglinear fit. This procedure leads to stepwise interactive graphical modeling of loglinear models. We show that it often results in a deeper understanding of the structure of the data. Linking mosaic plots to other interactive displays offers additional power that allows the investigation of more complex dependence models than provided by static displays.",

ABSTRACT: Cobwebs represent the categories of cross-classifying variables by nodes on the arcs of a circle. Linking two nodes by a line provides information about the corresponding two-variable marginal table. In this paper the widths of the lines are proportional to the square of the adjusted residuals corresponding to the fit of the independence model to the marginal table. Lines are shaded to indicate the signs of the residuals. The method can be used with variables of mixed types and for conditional independence models.",

        "abstract": "Parallel Hierarchies - Parallel Sets for hierarchical categorical data. The visualization of categorical datasets is an open field of research. While a number of standard diagramming techniques exist to investigate data distributions across multiple properties, these are rarely geared to take advantage of additional data properties \u2013 either given or derived. As a result, the data display is not as expressive as it could be when incorporating these properties, and it misses out on the potential of leveraging these properties for the data\u2019s interactive exploration. In this paper, we present the visualization technique Parallel Hierarchies that is specifically tailored to take hierarchical categorizations into account. With Parallel Hierarchies, it is possible to individually adjust the desired level of detail for each categorical data property through drill-down and roll-up operations. This enables the analyst to selectively change levels of detail as the data analysis progresses and new questions arise. We illustrate the utility of Parallel Hierarchies with a demographic and a biological use case, and we report on a qualitative user study evaluating this visualization technique in an industrial scenario.",

ABSTRACT: In this paper a novel approach is described for tree visualization using nested circles. The brother nodes at the same level are represented by externally tangent circles; the tree nodes at different levels are displayed by using 2D nested circles or 3D nested cylinders. A new layout algorithm for tree structure is described. It provides a good overview for large data sets. It is easy to see all the branches and leaves of the tree. The new method has been applied to the visualization of file systems.",

We call our framework product plots, alluding to the computation of area as a product of height and width, and the statistical concept of generating a joint distribution from the product of conditional and marginal distributions. The framework, with extensions, is sufficient to encompass over 20 visualisations previously described in fields of statistical graphics and infovis, including bar charts, mosaic plots, treemaps, equal area plots and fluctuation diagrams.",

ABSTRACT: In this paper we introduce multidimensional visualization and interaction techniques that are an extension to related work in parallel histograms and dynamic querying. Bargrams are, in effect, histograms whose bars have been tipped over and lined up end-to-end. We discuss affordances of parallel bargrams in the context of systems that support consumer-based information exploration and choice based on the attributes of the items in the choice set. Our tool called EZChooser has enabled a number of prototypes in such domains as Internet shopping, investment decisions, college choice, and so on, and a limited version has been deployed for car shopping. Evaluations of the techniques include an experiment indicating that trained users prefer EZChooser over static tables for choice tasks among sets of 50 items with 7-9 attributes.",
